# Let's Hang #
## Use Cases ##
### Example 1 ###

**Bob**

Bob decides that he want to catch up with a couple of friends that he hasn't seen in a while. He pulls out his phone and opens up the Let's Hang app. He clicks on the chat button to send out a message. After thinking for a bit, he decides it would be nice to see Jill, Tom, and Julie.

Bob clicks the icon to start a new chat. In the text box he starts typing Jill's name and when he see it in the list he touches her name a chip with Jill's name appears in the search box. Bob repeats this for Tom but when he types Julie's name he does not see it in the list. He touches the "+" to add a new contact.

The Let's Hang app presents Bob with a wizard. The first step of the wizard is logging onto Google to retreive his contacts. He touches the Google item, then enters his user account and password. The next page has a search box and list, much like the chat that he looked at previously. He types Julie's name, sees it in the list, and selects it to open it up. He notices that her address is not there, but he knows she lives in Piscataway, NJ so he enter those into the city and state and clicks Ok.

With his friends choosen, Bob clicks in the message area and types a simple note: "You guys want to get together tonight?". He clicks send.

**Jill**

Jill glances at her phone and sees a notification from the Let's Hang app. She clicks on the notification to open Let's Hang, which opens on Bob's chat. She sees that it's a group chat with Tom and Julie. Julie touches the "I'm in" response and the app prompts her with the question "shall we use your current location?". She clicks "Yes". And puts her phone away.

**Tom**

Tom sees a notification from Bob on Let's Hang and he clicks it. The app opens up on Bob's chat, and like Jill, Tom sees that Bob has started a group chat about getting together. Tom remembers that he has something else to do and touches the "I can't make it" response. He puts his phone away.

**Julie**

Julie does not get a notification from Let's Hang, instead she receives a text from Bob asking if she wants to get together. There is a link in the text and when she touches it, the Let's Hang app opens and she sees the group chat. Julie decides to click "I'm in". When she does, the app asks her if it can use her location, or if she would rather provide a location. She chooses to provide a location and she enters her address. When she clicks Ok, Let's Hang asks if she would like to register for a free account. She clicks "Yes" and fills out a simple profile form. When she is done, the app returns to the chat.

**Note**. Regardless of whether Julie chooses to register or not, an account is created on her behalf. If she does not register, the account key will be her phone number.

**Bob**

As each person accepts or declines his invitation, Bob receives a notification. Once he feels that he has reeived all the responses, Bob decides to pick a time and place to get together. When he opens the group chat, he finds a button for creating an event. He clicks the button.

The app opens the wizard for adding the event. He confirms the date and time and types a name for the event, in this case he enters "Coffee with Jill and Julie". He clicks next and is shown a map. There is a circle around in the middle between the three of them. He moves the circle over a little to an area he knows has a lot of restaurants and clicks next.

The app presents him with a list of places of interest within the circle on the map. He shortens the list by choosing "Coffee" from a list of search filters and finds a Starbucks. Bob clicks the Starbucks and then an Ok button.

The app shows Bob a confirmation where he is given the option to send out invites. He clicks the "Send" button and puts his phone away.

**Jill**

Jill receives a notification from the Let's Hange app. When she clicks it, she is shown a summary of the invitation. It shows that Bob, Jill, and Julie are meeting at Starbucks at 6:00pm that evening. There is a button to RSVP and she accepts.

**Julie**

Like Jill, Julie sees the notification and accepts the RSVP.

**Bob**

Let's Hang knows how long it will take Bob to drive to Starbucks. So 15 minutes before he should leave, the app sends a notification telling him to leave. When he clicks the notification the app opens the map and asks if he needs directions. When he clicks for directions, Google Maps opens on his phone. Bob leaves and uses Google to get him to Starbucks.

**Jill and Julie**

Jill and Julie have the same experience.

**Bob**

When Bob reaches Starbucks, he opens Let's Hang and clicks on the today's event. He touches a button to indication that "I'm here". He pages over to the map and sees pins indicating where Jill and Julie are. They are close and he knows they are about to have a good time.

**Bob, Jill, and Julie**

The following day Let's Hang sends a notification to Bob, Jill, and Julie asking them to rate their event. When they click the notificaiton, they see a short survey that asks them to rate their destination (Starbucks), Let's hang, and whether they had a good time.
